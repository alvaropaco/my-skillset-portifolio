# AI Code Challenge

## Project

The purpose of this project is to assess your knowledge of AI, plus your coding and written communication skills.

Work on this challenge as you would work as a member of a development team. Consider the other devs that will review your code as your teammates in this project.

Please **do not** work more than 8 hours on this without checking in with us to see if you're on the right path. We don't want to waste your time.

### Task

Find three models that can generate code. Build an agent that uses these models to convert the attached [codebase](./codebase/) from JavaScript to TypeScript. Then produce a report detailing which model you think was best for this task and why.

## Rules

- Use Python or JavaScript for the agent
- You can use ANY open source library
- You can use ANY existing model, open or closed

## FAQs

### Can I start right away?
Whatever works best for you. However, we don’t expect you to start until you have received your BTC payment.

### I have already spent 8 hours working on the code challenge, and it’s still a work in progress. What should I do?
1. Commit and push your work as it will help us know if you are on the right path
2. Reach out to our recruitment team (or the one who sent you the code challenge) and let them know about it
3. Our recruiter will get back to you at the earliest - letting you know whether adding more efforts to the code challenge is worth your time

### Can I add unit tests to my solution?
Not only you can, you should. We love solutions backed by tests, and to tell you a little secret - you’d earn bonus points by doing that!

### I am stuck. What should I do?
Please reach out to our recruiter, and we will try our best to help you.

If you still have questions, don't hesitate to ask your recruiter!
